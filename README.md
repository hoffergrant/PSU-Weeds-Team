# PSU-Weeds-Team
This is a repository for the Penn State weed science labs for sharing code and digital resources.

Here, you will find code for R scripts relating to various data cleaning processes, analyses, and visualizations that are common across the PSU weed team's members. These should be organized by folder with short, descriptive names like 'USA-Map-with-Color.R'. This repository is currently visible to the public, but only lab members will be permitted to post content. This attribute can be changed at any time to safeguard against unwanted use of original code.
