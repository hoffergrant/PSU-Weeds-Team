# PSU-Weeds-Team
This is a repository for the Penn State weed science labs for sharing code and digital resources.

Here, you will find code for R scripts relating to various data cleaning processes, analyses, and visualizations that are common across the PSU weed team's members. These should be organized by folder with short, descriptive names like 'USA-Map-with-Color.R'. All scripts or markdown documents should include information at the beginning of each code with a short description of the code's function, who made it, and when. Code should be annotated throughout to describe each action performed by the code so that a user can confidently understand and apply the code to their specific situation.

This repository is currently visible to the public, but only lab members will be permitted to post content. This attribute can be changed at any time to safeguard against unwanted use of original code.
